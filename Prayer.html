<p>Dear Sisters and Brothers in Christ!</p>

<p>This is our weekly reminder to pray and we also thank you for accepting the commitment of praying today for our parish, our priest and for the universal Catholic Church. <br></p>
<p> Through your prayers, know that you are responding to the lord&apos;s invitation of a personal and communal relationship with him. Like a good loving father, he is always waiting and willing to hear from you and he wishes to give you what you NEED. We nourish the relationship we have with our lord by praying daily and also are examples of faith in action to all our loved ones
<br></p>
<p> According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, there are various form of prayer. These various forms of prayer can be prayer of adoration, prayer of petition, prayer of intercession, prayer of being thankful, and prayer of praise. Whichever form of prayer you feel most comfortable with know that God will reveal himself to you through his son, and the Holy Spirit. Be willing to listen and be willing to submit your will. Finally, prayer is powerful and effective when one does so with a heart full of faith and love. </br></p>
<p>Below you will find our &quot;Battle Cry&quot;use it with your prayer as a form of encouragement or simply speak from your heart.</p>
<p>Love and Prayers,
<br>Jean D</p>

<p > <b>OUR BATTLE CRY </b>
<br>Lord God, I am strong in You and in your might when I clothe myself in your whole armor.
<br>So I stand and fasten the belt of truth around my waist,
<br>I put on the breastplate of righteousness,
<br>I shod my feet with the equipment of the gospel of peace;
<br>I take the shield of faith to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one, And
<br>I take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,which is the word of God.
<br>With this armor I am now ready for spiritual battle,
<br>so I ask You, O Lord, with a prayer fervent and intentional:
<br>Give our parish priests a holy zeal,
<br>Give our parishioners a lively faith, and
<br>Give to the universal Catholic Church your spiritual defense.
<br>Give to us all, your sons and daughters,
<br>a hunger to know Jesus, His Church, and the Sacraments,
<br>and a missionary heart to love Him more deeply and intimately.
<br>For these favors I offer you, O God,
<br>my sacrifice of a contrite and humble heart.  Amen </p>
Love and Prayers,
<br>Your Parish Prayer Captain
